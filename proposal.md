# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ultimate Snake Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a applicarion which allow allow the user to play the snake game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will allow for the game to quit, restart and for movement from the snake. At the start of the game there will be a main menu with a start button which will allow the user to start the game. The game will be formated in a grid structure where if the snake touches the outside boundaries then the game will end and it will send the user back to the beginning. The game will have food which the snake must eat to grow alongside random traps to make the game difficult.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Woyhi Tahsin, woyhibul.tahsin@temple.edu, Chong Li

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I hope to accomplish the movement aspect and the game ending function if the snake hits the boundaries.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can accomplish the snake being able to grow and move aswell as change its color when it reaches a certain point.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to accomplish snake movement, snake growing when consuming food, game ending if snake hits the boundary, include traps and super food for the snake

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Me and my partner need to research on how to include movement, add items to the game add a start button that works when its clicked on.
